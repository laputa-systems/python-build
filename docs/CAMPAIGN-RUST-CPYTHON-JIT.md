# rust-cpython JIT campaign

The single campaign for the `rust-cpython/` research lane's Rust execution
pipeline. Track **J** builds a Rust optimizing tier on CPython 3.16's tier-2
JIT. Track **C** ports Serc, a Rust source-to-bytecode compiler, to the same
3.16. Lane **R1** studies CinderX as a performance reference for track J.

It replaces `CAMPAIGN-JIT.md` (J0-J9, closed 2026-11-01),
`CAMPAIGN-JIT-CLIMB.md` (hill-climb, 2026-11-02), and
`CAMPAIGN-JIT-CINDERX-316.md` (R0-R3, 2026-11-09); their text is in git at
`76de0e1`. The campaign runs unattended. Every rule below is written so an
agent can apply it without asking; owner input is collected asynchronously
(see **Owner queue**) and blocks only the lane that needs it.

## Goal and end state

On current CPython 3.16, make the lane's tier-2 JIT four times faster than the
lane's own interpreter on the training kernels, with optimizer passes written
in Rust; and compile Python source in-process with a Rust compiler that is
byte-identical to CPython's. Python semantics and the 3.15.1 product do not
change.

The campaign is **done** when all of these hold at one commit on `main`:

1. The lane builds one pinned 3.16 `main` commit (see **Source epochs**) with
   the unchanged LLVM pins.
2. On macOS arm64 the JIT incumbent meets **M4**: `S ≤ 0.25`, every training
   kernel ≤ 0.45, held-out geomean ≤ `S^0.5`, no guard regression, and the
   memory and code-size bars in **Targets**.
3. Every accepted track J step passed **J acceptance**, and new optimizer passes
   live in Rust under the **Rust rule**.
4. Track C meets **C3** on the same epoch: `perf-rust-serc` compiles every
   source-mode `exec`, `eval`, and `single` request through Serc in-process,
   byte-identical to upstream CPython on the corpus at `-O0`/`-O1`/`-O2`, with
   full-suite parity and ACCEPT cold-import gates.
5. The combined build `perf-rust-jit-serc` reproduces the M4 score within the
   A/A spread, the C3 corpus parity, and the J targeted suites.
6. On Linux x86-64, the combined build fails exactly its no-JIT, no-Serc
   sibling's failed-test set, matches every kernel digest, and passes the
   differential fuzzer and the C1 corpus. Linux timing is reported, not gated.
7. The ledger has M4, C3, and closing rows.

The campaign **ends incomplete** when T4's backlog is empty without M4, or
when track C exhausts its attempts without C3; the closing row records how
far each track got and why. A stopped, blocked, or host-busy run is never a
met goal.

Out of scope: any change to the production 3.15.1 build, a JIT- or
Serc-enabled distribution, Linux arm64, free-threading, PGO, BOLT, the
tail-call interpreter, and a method-based JIT frontend (PEP 836, parked).

## Execution model

### Start here

An agent resuming the campaign reads, in order: **Status** (which lanes are
active, parked, or waiting), this section, the active item's section, and
**Boundary**. It then continues every lane that is not parked. It never
re-derives a decision recorded here.

### Lanes

| Lane | Items, in order | Depends on |
| --- | --- | --- |
| J | R0 → T1 → M1 → T2 → M2 → T3 → M3 → T4 → M4 | T2 ceilings need R1's catalog |
| R1 | CinderX study | nothing; starts now |
| C | C0 → marshal parity; C1 → C2 → C3 | C1 needs R0's chosen SHA, not R0's exit |
| Close | combined build, Linux confirmation | M4 and C3 on one epoch |

Each lane works in its own worktree `.work/wt/<item>` on branch
`campaign/<item>`, created with `perf.py setup-worktree` so caches are shared.
`TMPDIR` points at `.work/tmp`.

### Integration

- A lane integrates an accepted change by rebasing onto `main`, rerunning the
  narrowest check its change affects, and fast-forwarding `main`. Only one lane
  integrates at a time; the others rebase before their next gate.
- Commits are Conventional Commits scoped `jit`, `serc`, `marshal`, `bench`,
  or `docs`; the body names the item and the commands with their results.
  Accepted steps land on `main` without owner review (OD9). Nothing is pushed.
- After every accepted step or milestone, the lane rewrites its **Status** row
  and adds its **Ledger** row in the same commit. Status is rewritten in
  place, never appended.
- Default-build changes from track C (marshal parity) land only at a J
  milestone boundary or before R0 step 5, so they never move a J measurement
  mid-tier. They get a ledger row; track J rebuilds its incumbent and
  re-measures `S` after one lands.

### Host

- Builds, suites, and benchmarks go through `perf.py`, whose host lease lets
  builds and tests share the host and gives a measurement exclusive use across
  all worktrees. Work outside `perf.py` (CinderX and Serc test builds) never
  runs while `perf.py status` shows a measurement holding the lease.
- Until **Close**, timing gates are waived (OD14): no step waits for a quiet
  host or a `perf-gate-ready` window, and no step lands or is rejected on a
  timing result. The rules below apply to the timing gates **Close** runs.
- Gate evidence counts only when `perf-gate-ready` exits 0 immediately before
  and `perf-gate-ready -1` exits 0 immediately after. If the gate refuses
  three times at least 20 minutes apart, record "perf gate deferred: host
  busy" in Status, do other non-timing work, and retry at the next
  checkpoint. A deferred gate is never a pass.
- Delete a rejected candidate's build (`perf.py clean --name <build>`) and
  worktree when its ledger row lands. Keep named builds in **Builds**.

### Attempts and parking

- A failing item gets its root cause before any retry. An item gets at most
  three root-caused attempts unless its section says otherwise.
- To park an item: push nothing, keep its branch as `lane/<item>`, and record
  in Status the cause, the evidence path, and the condition that reopens it.
  The lane moves to its next unblocked item; if none exists, the lane is
  parked.
- Fix an egregious local defect met on the way (crash, wrong output, a
  harness step twice as slow as recorded) in its own commit. Anything else
  goes to `docs/open-work.md`.
- The campaign session ends when every lane is parked, waiting on the owner,
  or done. The final message lists each lane's state and the owner queue.

### Owner queue

Owner reviews are asynchronous. A contract change lands once it passes its
track's acceptance, including the independent review, and is added to the
**Owner queue** in Status. If the owner rejects it later, it is reverted and
the affected steps are re-gated. Only these items block, and only their own
lane: **Overfit review**, a lock or production change outside **Boundary**,
and an LLVM incompatibility that patching `Tools/jit` cannot fix.

## Boundary

- **Production is frozen.** No edits to root `build.py`, `buildsys/`,
  `backend/`, `patches/`, `sources.lock.json`, `bootstrap.lock.json`,
  `release-budgets.json`, or CI. Reading them, or building a production input
  archive into `.work/`, is allowed.
- **LLVM is fixed (OD1).** Stencils use the locked LLVM: 23.1.4 on macOS arm64
  (`bootstrap.lock.json`) and 23.1.2 on Linux x86-64
  (`rust-cpython/linux-toolchain.lock.json`), through configure's
  `LLVM_VERSION` and `LLVM_TOOLS_INSTALL_DIR`. Upstream's "LLVM 21" warning is
  accepted. No other LLVM, system clang, runtime LLVM, asmjit, or GCC enters a
  lane build. Spikes may extract further members of the locked archive into
  `.work/`. R1's CinderX build is scratch and may use the toolchain CinderX
  documents; nothing it builds enters the lane.
- **Locks.** R0 and later epoch refreshes edit the CPython record in
  `rust-cpython/sources.lock.json`; C0 adds the Serc record. Vetted crates for
  the **Rust rule** and track C update the overlay `Cargo.lock` with their
  licenses recorded. Every other lock, `rust-toolchain.toml`, and the vendored
  benchmark wheels stay as they are.
- **Frozen harness.** From M0 on, a J step whose diff touches `benchmarks/`,
  `perf_verdict.py`, or the fuzzer's comparison logic is rejected
  (`climb-step` enforces this). R0 may repair the harness for 3.16 before M0.
  Track C may add new workloads outside the J training, held-out, and guard
  sets, never edit existing ones. Thresholds never change.
- **TLS stays out.** `_ssl_rs`, `_hashlib_rs`, RTLS/Graviola, and trust-store
  code are untouched. Serc's SipHash `.pyc` source hashing is unrelated.
- **Hosts.** Performance runs on macOS arm64. Linux x86-64 correctness runs in
  the local image `rust-cpython-linux:20260401` (see **Lane host**); no image
  build, pull, or prune. Where the image is absent, Linux items park as "needs
  environment" and the rest continues.
- **Network.** Allowed reads: lane `fetch` and `perf.py fetch` of locked
  inputs, `git ls-remote`/archive downloads of `python/cpython`, and clones of
  pinned CinderX and Serc commits into `.work/`. No pushes, PRs, issues, or
  comments anywhere, including upstream Serc, CinderX, or CPython.

## Reference roles

| Role | What | Used for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Semantic oracle | `perf-upstream`, `perf-upstream-jit`: unmodified CPython at the epoch commit | Python semantics, upstream-red attribution |
| Parity reference | The candidate's sibling: same overlay commit, same flags minus the feature under test | Failed-test sets and workload digests |
| Performance reference | Pinned [CinderX](https://github.com/facebookincubator/cinderx) on stock CPython 3.15.1, inside its supported range `>=3.14.5,<3.16` | Which mechanisms pay off and by how much; never semantics |
| Compiler oracle | `perf-upstream` compiling and marshalling the same file | Byte-identical code objects for track C |
| Compiler starting point | Pinned [Serc](https://github.com/astral-experiments/serc), MIT OR Apache-2.0, newest target 3.15.0rc2 | Track C's compiler and marshal writer |

CinderX numbers are within-version uplifts (3.15 JIT over 3.15 no-JIT),
reported beside the lane's 3.16 uplift, never against it.

## Rust rule

New optimizer passes (analysis, unboxing decisions, inline-cache
specialization, inlining, allocation removal, register allocation) are written
in Rust in one overlay crate, `rust-cpython/overlay/Modules/_jit_opt_rs/`, and
called from the tier-2 pipeline. C stays only where it must: stencil
templates compiled by the locked clang, the existing hooks in
`overlay/Python/optimizer.c` and `jit.c`, and the smallest glue between them
and the crate. No handwritten assembly (ENGINEERING rule 9). T1's runtime
fixes are changes to existing C paths and are exempt.

The crate and its hook are a contract change: the first candidate that adds
them goes to the **Owner queue**.

## Builds

| Build | `perf.py build` flags | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `perf-upstream` | `--empty-overlay` | semantic and compiler oracle |
| `perf-upstream-jit` | `--empty-overlay --jit` | upstream JIT control |
| `perf-rust` | — | no-JIT sibling, track C baseline |
| `perf-rust-jit` | `--jit` | J incumbent (`@incumbent-jit`) |
| `perf-rust-jit-aa` | `--jit` | A/A twin, built at M0 only |
| `perf-climb-ref` | — | frozen no-JIT reference for the epoch |
| `perf-jit-<mechanism>` | `--jit` | J candidate or probe |
| `perf-rust-serc` | `--serc` | C incumbent |
| `perf-serc-<item>` | `--serc` | C candidate |
| `perf-rust-jit-serc` | `--jit --serc` | combined build at Close |

`--serc` does not exist yet; C2 adds it to `perf.py build` and
`rust-cpython/build.py build`. Serc is linked only into `--serc` builds.
"Rebuild clean" means `perf.py clean --name <build>` then `perf.py build`
with the table's flags at `main`'s head.

## Definitions

- **Training set:** 16 kernels from the pinned pyperformance 1.14.0 wheel
  (`benchmarks/workloads/jit_kernels.py`): `richards`, `scimark_sor`,
  `nbody`, `scimark_lu`, `spectral_norm`, `scimark_fft`,
  `scimark_sparse_mat_mult`, `scimark_monte_carlo`, `float`, `deltablue`,
  `fannkuch`, `chaos`, `nqueens`, `go`, `hexiom`, `raytrace`.
- **Held-out set:** `barnes_hut`, `pidigits`, `pyflate`, `coroutines`,
  `generators`, `comprehensions`, `richards_super`, `meteor_contest`. Run with
  `--jit-heldout`; `perf.py profile` refuses them.
- **Guard set:** the non-kernel workloads in `--jit-set --gate`
  (`django_template_realistic`, `django_wsgi_request`, `import_django`,
  `python_startup`, `serialization_roundtrip`, `zlib_decode_1m`,
  `gzip_extract_1m`).
- **Kernel CPU (OD8):** user plus system `getrusage` over each kernel's timed
  region, including compilation and warmup inside it. Wall and process CPU
  stay recorded.
- **Score `S`:** geometric mean over the training set of the pooled median
  kernel-CPU ratio, from `perf.py bench --baseline perf-climb-ref --candidate
  perf-rust-jit --jit-set --runs 5`.
- **Held-out score:** the same over the held-out set, with `--jit-heldout`.
- **JIT code bytes:** per kernel, the summed executor code size in the
  `PYTHON_JIT_MAP` output of one registry-size run. R0 adds this to
  `perf.py` before M0 if no command reports it.

## Targets

Fixed; only the owner changes them. A missed milestone is recorded with its
`S`, and the lane moves to the next tier.

| Milestone | `S` | Subset bar | Tier |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| M0 | measured | epoch pinned, A/A spread recorded | R0 |
| M1 | ≤ 0.62 | no training kernel above 0.80 | T1 runtime overheads |
| M2 | ≤ 0.48 | numeric geomean (nbody, spectral_norm, float, five scimark) ≤ 0.35 | T2 unboxing |
| M3 | ≤ 0.38 | object geomean (richards, deltablue, go, chaos, raytrace, hexiom, nqueens, fannkuch) ≤ 0.50 | T3 inlining and allocation removal |
| M4 | ≤ 0.25 | every training kernel ≤ 0.45 | T4 backend |

**Milestone gate.** With `perf-rust-jit` rebuilt clean, run the `S` command,
the held-out command, and `perf.py bench --baseline perf-climb-ref
--candidate perf-rust-jit --jit-set --gate --runs 5`, each between
`perf-gate-ready` checks, and measure JIT code bytes. The milestone is met
when all of these hold:

- `S` and the subset bar meet the row.
- **Held-out:** held-out score ≤ `S^0.5`. A miss is **Overfit review**: the
  J lane parks and the owner decides which steps since the last milestone
  stay.
- **Guard:** no guard workload regresses under the unchanged gate policy.
- **Memory (OD4):** each kernel's peak RSS within +8% of `perf-climb-ref`;
  JIT code bytes per kernel within 2x the epoch's M0 incumbent.

## Track J

### R0: refresh to latest 3.16 and rebaseline

1. Resolve `python/cpython` `main` with `git ls-remote`, download its archive,
   and record the SHA, SHA-256, and size in Status. Work in
   `.work/wt/r0`; the lock change lands on `main` with R0's exit.
2. Port the overlay: bytecodes and uops, optimizer, stencil layout, runtime
   helpers, frames, C-API, Rust bindings, Rust modules.
3. Confirm the locked LLVM regenerates stencils, links, and produces ThinLTO
   output. If it fails and an overlay patch to `Tools/jit` cannot fix it in
   three attempts, park the J lane (owner-blocking).
4. Build `perf-upstream`, `perf-upstream-jit`, `perf-rust`, and
   `perf-rust-jit`. Run `perf.py test --all` on each, the targeted suites,
   pydebug, and the fuzzer at 2,000 programs for seeds 0-2. **Parity:** each
   overlay build fails no test that its upstream counterpart passes; tests red
   on upstream are recorded as upstream-red with the upstream build's
   evidence. Recheck these 3.16.0a1 upstream findings and record each as
   fixed or still present:
   - a function that started function-entry tracing then runs under
     `sys.settrace` leaked one block per function with the JIT on;
   - `test_capi.test_opt` and `test_monitoring` failed from the second `-R`
     repetition because the GC invalidates cold executors;
   - `test_optimizer` leaked 6 references per run with or without the JIT.
   Keep the overlay's `effective_trace_length` pystats fix only if upstream
   still needs it. A parity failure gets three root-caused attempts per
   failing test file, then the J lane parks.
5. Repair `benchmarks/`, the fuzzer, or `climb-step` only where 3.16 broke
   them, and add the JIT code bytes measurement. The harness is frozen after
   this step.
6. Build `perf-climb-ref` and `perf-rust-jit-aa`. Run the A/A gate
   (`perf-rust-jit` against `perf-rust-jit-aa`, `--jit-set --gate --runs 5`),
   then the **Milestone gate** commands to measure `S0` and the held-out and
   guard baselines.

**Exit:** the lock change and M0 ledger row land on `main`. Linux x86-64 parity
for step 4 runs where the image exists; otherwise it parks under Close and
does not block M0.

### P1: ceilings (start of each tier)

Re-profile all 16 kernels with `perf.py profile --tool sample --jit-map`. For
each mechanism in the tier, build a throwaway probe `perf-jit-probe-<name>`
that removes the cost unsafely while keeping training digests, and gate it
against the incumbent with `climb-step --candidate`. Its ratio is the
mechanism's ceiling; record it in the ledger with verdict PROBE. Rank the
backlog by ceiling, and drop a mechanism under 1% unless it unblocks a later
tier. Costs that the profile shows as newly dominant join the backlog.

| Tier | Mechanism | Probe or ceiling source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| T1 | Thread-state lookup (`_tlv_get_addr`, 16.1% sampled on a1) | `_PyThreadState_GET` reads a plain global |
| T1 | Frame push and pop (`_PyFrame_ClearExceptCode`, `_PyEval_FrameClearAndPop`) | skip clearing frames that own no cells or escaping locals |
| T1 | `_CHECK_VALIDITY` and `_SET_IP` | strip both |
| T1 | Proven type and version guards | strip them |
| T2 | Float and int boxing | summed sampled share of allocation, dealloc, refcount, and type guards on numeric kernels, with R1's measured uplift |
| T3 | Python-to-Python calls | sampled share of frame and call uops |
| T3 | Short-lived allocations; attribute and global inline caches | sampled share of allocation and lookup, with R1's measured uplift |
| T4 | Spills, reloads, stencil glue | sampled share of `_SPILL_OR_RELOAD` and inter-stencil moves after T3 |

### T1: runtime overheads, toward M1

Attack only costs the new epoch's profile still shows. Per-call-site patches
bought about 1% each on a1, so the thread-state fix is systemic: pass `tstate`
or the interpreter through the freelist, allocation, and frame paths, correct
under threads and subinterpreters. Add `test_threading` and
`test_interpreters` to its targeted suites.

### T2: unboxing, toward M2

Keep exact floats and compact ints as machine values between uops; box only at
side exits, calls, heap stores, and trace end. Deopt rebuilds boxed values on
every introspection path the fuzzer covers. Candidates, in order: float
unboxing across binary ops and compares; int unboxing with overflow guards;
unboxed loop-carried locals.

### T3: inlining and allocation removal, toward M3

Inline Python-to-Python calls with lazy frame materialization on deopt. Add
attribute and global inline caches whose invalidation honours descriptors,
mutation, inheritance, lazy imports, and subinterpreters. Remove non-escaping
allocations. Lengthen traces with loop peeling and invariant-guard hoisting.

### T4: backend, toward M4

Revisit whole-trace register allocation (the a1 attempt cut spills 8% for no
measurable gain), then reduce stencil glue.

### J acceptance

Under OD14 a candidate lands on steps 3-6 alone, plus the memory and
code-size bars from **Targets** measured on any host. Steps 1, 2, and 7 and
the **Milestone gate** run at **Close** for the stacked result. A
`climb-step --screen` number on whatever host is free is recorded in the
ledger as advisory, verdict SCREEN; it never blocks. Mechanisms rank by
sampled profile share from `perf.py profile`, not by P1 probes.

After OD14 lifts, a candidate replaces the incumbent only when all hold:

1. **Gate:** `perf.py bench --baseline @incumbent-jit --candidate C --jit-set
   --gate --runs 5` returns ACCEPT under the unchanged `perf_verdict.py`
   policy (1% floor, 95% bootstrap), between `perf-gate-ready` checks.
2. **No kernel regression:** no training kernel's pooled kernel-CPU CI95
   lower bound exceeds 1.02 against the incumbent.
3. **Digests:** every training, held-out, and guard digest matches.
4. **Differential fuzz:** 2,000 programs from `rust-cpython/tests/jit_fuzz.py`
   give identical output, exceptions, and reference-tracer counts with the JIT
   on and off.
5. **Targeted suites:** the same failed-test set as `perf-rust` for
   `test_capi.test_opt`, any `test_jit*` files present at the pin, `test_float`, `test_long`,
   `test_sys_settrace`, `test_monitoring`, `test_generators`, `test_frame`,
   `test_gc`, `test_weakref`, plus any suites the item adds.
6. **Independent review:** a reviewer agent that did not write the change and
   has no access to the author's reasoning reads the diff. Its approval is
   required for any change to reference ownership, deopt, frame
   materialization, or executor invalidation; a demonstrated defect blocks.
7. **Clean rebuild:** a clean build of C reproduces the gate direction in a
   two-run check.

`perf.py climb-step --candidate C` runs steps 1-5 and prints one JSON verdict;
`--screen` first runs one training pass and gates only at a point estimate
≤ 0.99.

**Stacking.** An INCONCLUSIVE candidate with point estimate ≤ 0.995, no
regressed kernel, and steps 3-6 passed is tagged `stack/<mechanism>`. Two or
more stackable candidates that compose cleanly are gated as one candidate.

### J loop

1. If the tier has no ceilings, run P1. T2 waits for R1's catalog.
2. Take the top unparked mechanism. Write it in `.work/wt/<mechanism>`, at
   most two design variants per mechanism.
3. `perf.py build --name perf-jit-<mechanism> --jit --incremental`, then
   `climb-step --screen`. No win: discard and record why.
4. Run **J acceptance**.
5. Accepted: integrate, rebuild `perf-rust-jit` and `perf-rust` clean, update
   `S`. Rejected: ledger row, discard. Stackable: tag and ledger row.
6. When the backlog is empty, run the **Milestone gate** and record it, met or
   missed. Then consider a **Source epochs** refresh and move to the next
   tier.

**J stop rules.**

- After eight consecutive gated candidates fail, re-profile and re-rank once.
  If the next four also fail, the tier closes with its milestone recorded as
  missed, and the lane moves to the next tier. Closing T4 this way ends
  track J incomplete.
- A correctness failure that reproduces on the incumbent becomes the lane's
  top item: root-cause it, fix it under **J acceptance** steps 3-7, and add a
  fuzzer seed or test that catches it. Three failed attempts park the lane.

## R1: CinderX reference study

1. Build stock CPython 3.15.1 from the production source lock's archive into
   `.work/r1/`, and source-build CinderX at its latest `main` commit, recorded
   in Status, against it. Run CinderX's tests. Record source, ABI, dependency,
   and license closure.
2. Run the training and held-out kernels from
   `benchmarks/workloads/jit_kernels.py` with CinderX's JIT off and on, five
   interleaved runs each, while holding the host lease. Record kernel CPU,
   digests, code bytes, warmup, compile CPU, and peak RSS.
3. Read `Jit/hir/`, `Jit/lir/`, `Jit/codegen/`, `Jit/inline_cache.cpp`, guard
   invalidation, type feedback, inlining, and deopt. For each mechanism
   record its source, version assumptions, the semantics it must preserve,
   its contribution on our kernels (by disabling it through CinderX's own
   switches where they exist), and the tier it belongs to.
4. Do not adopt CinderX's runtime, Static Python, lightweight frames,
   parallel GC, or build system. Copying code requires a license and
   attribution review in the **Owner queue**; prefer an independent Rust
   implementation.

**Exit:** a **CinderX catalog** section added below **Status**, ranked by
measured contribution, and a ledger row with CinderX's within-version `S`.
The catalog's report sets that uplift beside M2-M4 in the **Owner queue**.
Targets stand unless the owner moves them; T2 does not wait for an answer.

**Setup (done 2026-11-09).** Rebuild it into `.work/r1/` when absent:

- CPython 3.15.1 from the root `sources.lock.json` archive (sha256
  `673ae723…f99b`): `./configure --prefix=$PWD/.work/r1/install
  --with-ensurepip=install`, `make`, `make install`.
- CinderX `e48f370dfcc045db32ac19142419043342b10cfb`: `python3 setup.py
  bdist_wheel` with that interpreter, then install the wheel into it. Closure:
  CinderX MIT, asmjit Zlib, and fmt, parallel-hashmap, usdt, capstone, and
  googletest fetched by CMake; lightweight frames, parallel GC, and Static
  Python are off on 3.15.
- Tests: `pytest cinderx/PythonLib/test_cinderx/` (3035 passed, 566 skipped)
  and `RuntimeTests` with the CI macOS arm64 filter (1205 passed, 7 skipped).
- JIT off: `-X cinderx-jit-disable`. JIT on: `-X cinderx-jit-all -X
  cinderx-jit-background-compile=0`, which compiles every function on its
  first call. The timed runs also measure CinderX's default `cinderx.jit.auto()`
  policy, because compile-everything inflates compile CPU and code bytes.
- `rust-cpython/tests/cinderx_kernels.py --python <interp>` runs all 24
  kernels in both modes; every digest matches across modes and the harness.

If CinderX does not build or pass its tests on 3.15.1 within three
root-caused attempts, R1 ends with a source-only catalog (step 3 without
measured contributions), and T2-T4 rank by the lane's own profiles.

## Track C: Rust source compiler (Serc on 3.16)

Serc compiles Python source to CPython bytecode; it does not make execution
faster. It targets cold imports, `compile()`, and `exec()` of uncached source
(the product ships no `.pyc`), and provides a byte-exact marshal writer. Only
the port to the pinned 3.16 epoch is in scope.

### C0: vet and pin

1. Pin Serc `bc563167` (release 0.1.11) as a second source record in
   `rust-cpython/sources.lock.json` with archive SHA-256 and size. Lane changes
   live in `rust-cpython/serc-overlay/`, mirroring the archive's paths.
2. Pin the `serc` crate's non-dev dependencies exactly in the overlay
   `Cargo.lock` with licenses, including the Ruff parser crates at the git
   revision Serc pins, and `stacker`, whose `psm` dependency compiles C and
   assembly through `cc` with the locked clang, never GCC. Extend lane
   `fetch` to cache the git dependency so builds stay offline. Exclude the
   CLI, benchmark crates, `mimalloc`, and `rayon` from the lane workspace.
3. Record the dependency closure and the `libpython` text-size delta of
   linking the bare compiler into a scratch `--serc` prototype.

**Exit:** the source record and lock entries land; Serc's own tests pass on
the pinned toolchain.

**Vetting result (2026-11-10).** Archive sha256
`4db43e58bd6f3b7e46728f686c7482d4404b61fe5143371642e1940041d3e84b`, 3,445,293
bytes. `cargo test -p serc --locked` passes 8,624 tests on `nightly-2026-09-15`
with the locked clang 23.1.4, against CPython 3.12-3.15 oracles. The non-dev
closure is 97 crates, all permissive (MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD, Unicode, Zlib,
Unlicense), plus `ruff_python_parser` at git `9d0f58b1`. Three constraints
follow:

- The repo's `.cargo/config.toml` replaces crates-io with the `stuff` mirror,
  which lacks 47 of the crates (every `ruff_*` 0.0.15, `psm`, `stacker`,
  `cc`, `dashu-int`). Serc's dependencies come from crates.io (OD13): lane
  `fetch` resolves crates-io from the official index for the overlay
  workspace, with `--locked` checksums as the integrity check. The repo-wide
  `.cargo/config.toml` is unchanged.
- cc-rs prefers `HOST_CC` over `CC`, and the host cargo config sets
  `HOST_CC="kache clang"`, so `psm` silently compiles with Apple clang. Every
  build that compiles Serc exports `HOST_CC`, `HOST_CXX`, and `HOST_AR` as the
  locked LLVM tools.
- A binary that calls the compiler gains about 9.2 MB of text (staticlib
  probe, ThinLTO, prebuilt std), against about 3.3 MB of `libpython` text. C2's
  memory gate is the likely failure; C2 measures it first.

### Marshal parity

`_marshal_rs` writes valid bytes that differ from CPython's reference
selection, so `compileall_source` is excluded from control comparisons
(`KNOWN_CONTROL_MISMATCHES` in `rust-cpython/perf.py`). Make `_marshal_rs`
byte-identical to upstream `marshal.dumps`, using Serc's writer as the guide,
and remove the exclusion.

**Exit:** byte-identical `marshal.dumps` against `perf-upstream` over every
code object from the C1 corpus, `test_marshal` and `test_importlib` failing
the same tests as `perf-upstream`, and the marshal route verdicts unchanged.
Lands under the default-build rule in **Integration**.

### C1: port Serc to the epoch's 3.16

Add a 3.16 target for the epoch commit: opcodes, code-object layout,
exception and line tables, marshal rules, parser features, and compiler
passes. Add `rust-cpython/tests/serc_parity.py`: for each corpus file and
optimization level it compiles with `perf-upstream` (`compile()` then
`marshal.dumps`) and with Serc's CLI built in `.work/` from the pinned archive
plus `serc-overlay/`, and reports every byte mismatch as JSON. The CLI never
enters `libpython`.

**Corpus:** the epoch's `Lib/` and `Lib/test/`, plus the lane's pinned
benchmark source trees (Django and the `compileall_source`, `pylint_source`,
and `pycparser_source` inputs), at `-O0`, `-O1`, and `-O2`. Files that
upstream itself refuses to compile are listed and skipped on both sides.

**Exit:** zero mismatches and Serc's own tests green. Each distinct mismatch
class gets three root-caused attempts; an unresolved class parks track C with
the class, a minimal repro, and the upstream change that introduced it.

### C2: in-process `exec` mode

Add `--serc`. In `--serc` builds, source-mode `exec` compilation (imports,
`compile(..., "exec")`, `exec(str)`) calls Serc through a C entry point in the
overlay compile path. `eval`, `single`, and AST-object input go to the C
compiler by mode. A Serc error raises; it is never retried on the C compiler.
`PYTHONSERCVERIFY=1` compiles with both and raises on any difference.

Add three registry workloads, `cold_python_startup`, `cold_import_django`, and
`cold_import_app_stack`, that run with `-B` and a fresh empty
`PYTHONPYCACHEPREFIX`, so every module, stdlib included, compiles from source.

**Exit:** `perf-rust-serc` fails exactly `perf-rust`'s `perf.py test --all`
set; one full-suite run under `PYTHONSERCVERIFY=1` reports no difference; and
`perf.py bench --baseline perf-rust --candidate perf-rust-serc --workload
cold_python_startup --workload cold_import_django --workload
cold_import_app_stack --workload compileall_source --gate --runs 5` is ACCEPT
under the unchanged verdict and memory policy. A REJECT gets profiling and
three optimization attempts; if all fail, track C ends incomplete with the
measured loss.

The hook, the `--serc` flags, and the new workloads go to the **Owner queue**.

### C3: all source modes

Extend the Serc path to `eval` and `single`, with C1's oracle extended to those
modes and C2's exit rerun. AST-object input (`compile(ast_obj, ...)`) stays on
the C compiler: Serc consumes Ruff's AST, and converting CPython's is out of
scope.

**Exit:** done-criterion 4 and a C3 ledger row.

### C acceptance

A track C change lands only when, on `perf-serc-<item>`: the C1 corpus has zero
mismatches; `perf.py test --all` fails exactly `perf-rust`'s set; from C2 on,
the full-suite verify run reports no difference; and an independent reviewer
approves any change to FFI, ownership, or the compile hook. Under OD14 the C2
and C3 exits are met without their timing gates, which run at **Close**.

## Close

Close first runs every timing gate OD14 deferred, on a quiet host: the
**Milestone gate** for the stacked J incumbent, the C2 and C3 cold-import
gates, and R1's remaining timed runs. A J regression found here is bisected
over the landed J steps and the offending steps reverted or fixed. Then, when
M4 and C3 hold on one epoch: build `perf-rust-jit-serc`, gate it with the
**Milestone gate** commands, rerun the C1 corpus and the J targeted suites on
it, then run done-criterion 6 on Linux x86-64. Write the closing ledger row,
rewrite **Status** with the final state, and clear resolved Owner queue
entries.

## Source epochs

An epoch is one pinned 3.16 commit with its own `perf-climb-ref`, incumbents,
A/A spread, and `S0`. Scores compare only within an epoch.

- A refresh happens only at a J milestone boundary, when the owner asks or
  when upstream has tagged a 3.16 pre-release since the current pin.
- A refresh reruns R0 on `main`'s code. The new epoch opens with an M0 row;
  milestones met earlier are re-gated before track J continues.
- If the refresh fails parity, the campaign stays on the previous epoch and
  retries at the next milestone boundary.
- Track C re-ports Serc to the new epoch and reruns C1's corpus before its next
  item. Track J never waits for it; C milestones count only on the epoch they
  were measured on.

## Owner decisions

- **OD1 (2026-11-01):** keep the pinned LLVM; see **Boundary**.
- **OD4:** memory gates stay as written; JIT against no-JIT keeps its peak RSS
  REJECT as a recorded cost.
- **OD7 (2026-11-02):** unboxing, escape analysis, inlining, and longer or
  speculative traces are in scope. Production stays JIT-disabled.
- **OD8 (2026-11-02):** fitness is kernel CPU.
- **OD9 (2026-11-02):** accepted steps land on `main` without owner review.
- **OD10 (2026-11-09):** track latest 3.16 `main` through **Source epochs**;
  CinderX is a performance reference only; new optimizer passes are Rust.
- **OD11 (2026-11-09):** track C ports Serc to the pinned 3.16 epoch only,
  runs in parallel with track J, and leaves TLS code untouched. The product
  compiler is not replaced.
- **OD12 (2026-11-09):** M4 stays the end goal. The campaign runs unattended;
  owner reviews are asynchronous except those listed in **Owner queue**.
- **OD13 (2026-11-10):** Serc's crate dependencies are fetched from crates.io,
  not the `stuff` mirror.
- **OD14 (2026-11-10):** feature completeness first. Timing gates are waived
  until **Close**; correctness, parity, memory, and code-size checks still
  gate every landing.
- **Parked:** a method-based frontend (withdrawn PEP 836 prototype, observed
  head `04a79098`) opens only by owner decision.

## Lane host

Linux x86-64 lane commands run in the local image `rust-cpython-linux:20260401`
(Ubuntu 24.04, the exact `linux-toolchain.lock.json` packages, rustup
`nightly-2026-09-15`):

```sh
docker run --rm --security-opt seccomp=unconfined --security-opt apparmor=unconfined \
  -v "$PWD:$PWD" -w "$PWD" -e TMPDIR="$PWD/.work/tmp" \
  rust-cpython-linux:20260401 <command>
```

Builds and `test --all` outlast 10 minutes; run them in the background. The
image is absent on the owner's macOS arm64 workstation (checked 2026-11-09).

## Debugging methods

1. **Compare against the sibling build.** `PYTHON_JIT=0` skips every
   `requires_jit_enabled` test, so it proves nothing for tier-2 tests.
   `python -I` implies `-E` and silently drops `PYTHON_JIT`.
2. **Shrink to pure Python first.** `sys.getallocatedblocks()` deltas over
   fresh `exec`'d functions and `_opcode.get_executor(code, i)` reproduce
   leaks and missing executors without a test runner. The GC invalidates cold
   executors, and backoff then blocks re-tracing. Warmup takes about 4,000
   iterations; a loop that raises every iteration never traces.
3. **A release SIGSEGV becomes an assertion under pydebug.** Run the test on
   `rust-cpython/stage/bin/python3.16d` with `PYTHON_LLTRACE=2`; the last trace
   printed before the abort is the suspect, not the reported
   `executor_cases.c.h` line.
4. **Bisect code generation with a runtime mask** in a throwaway build: read
   an env var once in the changed function, one bit per transition, and run
   the failing tests once per bit. Delete the build and mask before
   committing.
5. **Model an allocator offline** from `_opcode.get_executor` dumps and
   `_PyUop_Caching`; keep `-1` default entries in the table parse.
6. **Uop share is not CPU.** Check stencil body sizes in
   `jit_stencils-<triple>.h` before ranking a cost.
7. **pystats:** `perf.py build --jit --pystats`; per kernel,
   `sys._stats_clear()`, run, `sys._stats_off()`, `sys._stats_dump()` into an
   existing stats directory; summarize with the build's
   `Tools/scripts/summarize_stats.py`.
8. **Look in the locked LLVM archive, not the prefix,** for `opt`,
   `llvm-config`, `llvm-symbolizer`, headers, and the ASan runtime.
9. **Monitoring:** the JIT reports LINE events only at side exits, upstream
   included, so line sets are compared only between JIT-off runs. Event counts
   at `set_events` boundaries vary between identical runs.
10. **Bytecode mismatches:** diff `dis.dis(code, show_caches=True)` and the
    `co_linetable`/`co_exceptiontable` bytes before reading marshal output;
    most mismatches are in a table, not an instruction.
11. **Harness traps:** two containers in one directory collide on
    `test_python_<pid>`; a crashed test leaves mode-000 directories that break
    the next clean build (`chmod -R u+rwx`); delete a dropped `core`; never run
    bare `make` in a perf build directory; `rc=2` right after a crash is
    usually leftover scratch.

**Owner queue:** empty.

**Epoch e891** (`main` `e891a911`, pinned 2026-11-10) opened at R0 on macOS
arm64:

- **Parity.** `perf.py test --all` on the four builds: each overlay build
  fails only what its upstream counterpart fails
  (`test_multiprocessing_forkserver.test_misc`) plus known red: `test_ssl`
  (RTLS has no `HAS_ECH`, added upstream after a1), `test_support` (hashlib
  shim), and two post-a1 asyncio TLS tests, `test_sendfile` and
  `test_sslproto`, which depend on OpenSSL close-notify and BIO-buffer
  behaviour the frozen RTLS stack does not share. Fuzzer seeds 0-2 at 2,000
  programs: 0 mismatches. `perf.py` has no pydebug mode; the 3.16.0a1
  findings were rechecked on a pristine pydebug JIT build at the pin: the
  settrace block leak is gone, the `-R` failures of `test_capi.test_opt` and
  `test_monitoring` remain JIT-specific, and `test_optimizer` still leaks 6
  references per run with or without the JIT. The `effective_trace_length`
  pystats fix stays.
- **Measured.** A/A max 1.19% (`scimark_sparse_mat_mult`), geomean 1.0022.
  `S0 = 0.7748`, held-out 0.8216, both on a quiet host. Kernel peak RSS at
  most +5.4% (`hexiom`). Guard CPU ratios 0.980-1.006, from a run with one
  noisy host sample of six. M0 JIT code bytes (`perf.py jit-stats --ref
  perf-rust-jit --jit-set`): nbody 39,112; spectral_norm 18,880; float
  11,400; richards 144,612; raytrace 350,828; fannkuch 61,700; deltablue

  scimark_lu 56,796; scimark_monte_carlo 65,596.

**Epoch a1** (`v3.16.0a1`, `22d79d98`) closed at R0; its numbers do not carry
over. The P0 tooling it built stays: kernel-region CPU, the held-out set, the
differential fuzzer, and `climb-step`. Evidence from a1 that shapes the
backlog:

- Sampled cost ranking over 16 kernels: `_tlv_get_addr` 16.1%,
  `_PyFrame_ClearExceptCode` 3.2%, `PyFloat_FromDouble` 2.8%, `_POP_TOP` 2.3%.
  Executed-uop shares (Linux pystats): type guards 10.5%, `_SET_IP` 9.6%,
  `_CHECK_VALIDITY` 8.1%, `_SPILL_OR_RELOAD` 7.5%.
- Rejected one-site fixes: generic exact-float pop (REJECT, stencil 56 to 156
  bytes), outlined and inlined boxed-float reuse (INCONCLUSIVE and REJECT;
  parked at `lane/jit-boxed-float-reuse`), compact-int fast path
  (INCONCLUSIVE), whole-trace register cache (INCONCLUSIVE, 0.9993).
- Hybrid DynASM backend (python/cpython#146235): closed, not ported.
